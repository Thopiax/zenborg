/**
 * Project the effective blocklist → declarativeNetRequest *dynamic* rules.
 *
 * The `fences` collection is the source of truth, pushed into
 * chrome.storage.local by the native host as the fence record; this projects
 * that cache onto a single idempotent `block` rule. Re-running replaces it, so
 * it stays in sync after any add/remove with no leftover state.
 *
 * Why `block` and not `redirect` to a branded page: DNR's `redirect` (and
 * `modifyHeaders`) actions require *host permissions* for the target domain.
 * zenborg ships ZERO host_permissions on purpose — that's the structural guarantee
 * that it cannot read your browsing. `block` needs no host access, so it
 * preserves that property while actually stopping the page from loading. The
 * cost is the generic browser "blocked" page instead of the zenborg block page.
 *
 * Uses the native `chrome.declarativeNetRequest` (always present in MV3; the
 * WXT `browser` shim does not surface this namespace). Errors are logged, never
 * swallowed — a silently-failing blocker is worse than no blocker.

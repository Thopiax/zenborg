 * The unified Fence type — what is in force right now, as the extension sees it.

 * Replaces the retired `ArmedIntervention` from the old interventions module. The key
 * change from that type: `primitive` splits into `enforcement`, which
 * distinguishes `block` (what `cooldown` primitives become) from `gate`. Same
 * two primitives a browser can actuate, same invariant 6 — the type just
 * carries the name the rest of the rebuild uses.
 *
 * ── Invariant 6 is enforced at the parse boundary ───────────────────────
 *
 * `parseFences` (in `parse.ts`) refuses any entry that carries no reachable
 * exit. Sovereignty rests on the exit, not on who set the
 * fence, so a block with no visible way out is a bug rather than a stricter
 * shield.
 *
 * This file is pure: no chrome APIs, no clock, no storage.

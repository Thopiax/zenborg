# Sunset

Close the day. Look at what was planted and what grew, capture anything that happened but was not recorded, and optionally seed tomorrow's intentions.

## When to invoke

Trigger phrases:
- "/sunset", "good night", "boa noite"
- "I'm done for the day", "calling it", "wrapping up"
- "close the day", "end of day"

Do NOT trigger for:
- "good morning" or day open (sunrise)
- "I did X" mid-day (tend)
- "review the week" (weather)
- "plan the cycle" (season)

## Workflow

### 0. Materialize bedtime routine

Before reading the day, call `mcp__zenborg__materialize_routine { boundary: "EVENING->NIGHT" }` to plant any bedtime routine entries that haven't been planted yet today. Report what was created vs. already planted.

### 1. Read the day's record

Fetch today's state in parallel:
- `mcp__zenborg__list_moments` with `{ "day": "YYYY-MM-DD", "allocation": "allocated" }` for today
- `mcp__zenborg__list_areas` to map area names and emoji
- `mcp__zenborg__get_active_moment` to check if an intention is still set
- `mcp__garmin__get_sleep_summary` with today's date for last night's sleep (the night that opened this day)

### 2. Render the day summary

Present a compact reflection:

```
## Today (YYYY-MM-DD)

Morning:   Running, Coffee with Ada
Afternoon: Themia work, Meeting
Evening:   Reading
Night:     (empty)

4 areas touched: Fitness, Social, Themia, Mindfulness
```

### 3. Ask about unrecorded moments

Prompt gently:
- "Anything that happened today that isn't on the board?"
- "Any moments to capture before the day closes?"

If the user names activities, hand off to the tend workflow to decompose, resolve, and plant them.

### 4. Clear the active moment

If `get_active_moment` shows a stale intention, offer to clear it:
- "Your intention is still set to [moment]. Clear it for the night?"

On confirmation, call `mcp__zenborg__clear_active_moment`.

### 5. Sleep bookend

If sleep data is available, close the body loop that sunrise opened. Include last night's
sleep as context for how the day went. The gardener already lived the day; the observation
is for their own pattern recognition.

### 6. Seed tomorrow (optional)


If the user wants to look ahead:
- "Want to plant anything for tomorrow?"
- Check if there are already moments allocated for tomorrow

If the user names tomorrow's plans, use tend with `day = tomorrow`.

### 7. Write the day to journal oracle

Read `~/.zenborg/oracles.json` → `routes.journal`. Walk the oracle chain
(same protocol as close-up §3b): `check` → `read` (if present) → `write`.

Append a `## Sunset` section with §2's summary and areas touched.
Keep it brief — close-up entries already hold the session detail.

If no oracle is reachable, skip silently — the day lives in the garden only.

### 8. Close

End with a natural close. No summary statistics, no scores, no "well done." The day is complete because the gardener says it is.

## Rules

- Do NOT compute daily scores, completion rates, or streaks.
- Do NOT moralize about empty phases or unplanted areas.
- Clearing the active moment is optional, offered, never forced.
- If the user just says "good night" with no elaboration, render the summary and close. No interrogation.
- Reflective, not exhortative. The garden rests; the gardener rests.

/**
 * GarminHabitMap — Garmin activity type → zenborg habit.
 *
 * The sibling of keel's `~/.keel/area-map.json` (domain → area UUID). Same
 * spirit, different owner: keel's comment on that file reads *"keel's own
 * domain→area map stays keel's business, and stays local"* — the map lives
 * with its consumer. The consumer of THIS map is whatever plants moments in
 * the garden, and zenborg is the writer for `moments`. So it is zenborg's
 * business, and stays local to the vault.
 *
 * Why this exists: zenborg's wilting signal measures *logging*, not *living*.
 * Habits flagged 50–96 days dark are happening several times a week; the
 * garden simply never hears about it. Garmin already holds the ground truth.
 *
 * ## Shape, and why it differs from area-map.json
 *
 * `area-map.json` is a bare `Record<domain, areaId>` — it can afford opaque
 * UUIDs because keel resolves names live from `areas.json` at render time.
 * This map cannot. Its single most important entry is counter-intuitive
 * (`yoga → Vipassana`, NOT either habit literally named "yoga"), and a bare
 * UUID invites a future reader — human or agent — to "correct" it. The name
 * travels inline so the mapping can be audited by eye.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. Nothing reads the filesystem or the network.
